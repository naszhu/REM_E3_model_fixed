## Critical Bug Found and Fixed

**Issue**: The chunk boundary detection logic in `generate_finalt_probes()` was fundamentally broken, causing context drift to trigger 48x more often than intended.

**Root Cause**: The complex condition `(iprobe_chunk != findlast(x -> (iprobe - 1) > x, iprobe_chunk_boundaries))` was incorrectly detecting chunk boundaries, causing drift to happen for almost every probe instead of only at chunk boundaries.

**Impact**: 
- **Expected**: Context should drift only 9 times (at chunk boundaries)
- **Actual**: Context was drifting 432 times out of 492 probes (87.8%)
- **Result**: Massive interference in final test results, especially affecting unchanging context

**Code Location**: `E3/probe_generation.jl` lines 285-287

**Before (Broken)**:
```julia
if (iprobe != 1) && (iprobe_chunk != findlast(x -> (iprobe - 1) > x, iprobe_chunk_boundaries)) && (iprobe_chunk > 1) 
    drift_between_lists_final!(listcg, p_ListChange_finaltest[iprobe_chunk])
    drift_between_lists_final!(unchangecg, 0.001)
end
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```julia
if (iprobe != 1) && (iprobe_chunk > 1) && (iprobe_chunk != previous_chunk)
    drift_between_lists_final!(listcg, p_ListChange_finaltest[iprobe_chunk])
    drift_between_lists_final!(unchangecg, 0.001)
end
previous_chunk = iprobe_chunk  # Track for next iteration
```

**Why This Happened**: 
- The `findlast()` function was returning `nothing` in many cases
- The comparison `iprobe_chunk != nothing` was always `true`
- This caused the condition to pass for almost every probe

**Prevention**: 
- Always test complex logic conditions thoroughly
- Use simple, clear boundary detection instead of complex mathematical expressions
- The TODO comment existed but was never fully investigated

**Files Affected**: `E3/probe_generation.jl`

**Note**: This bug was present for a long time and explains why final test results were showing excessive interference. The fix ensures context only drifts at intended chunk boundaries.
