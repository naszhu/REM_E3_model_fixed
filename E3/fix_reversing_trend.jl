# The issue is that is_UnchangeCtxDriftAndReinstate was set to false
# This causes only changing context features to drift, while unchanging ones remain stable
# This imbalance creates the weird reversing trend in list results

println("=== ROOT CAUSE ===")
println("The commit changed is_UnchangeCtxDriftAndReinstate from true to false")
println("This creates an imbalance where:")
println("  - Changing context features drift during study-test intervals")
println("  - Unchanging context features do NOT drift")
println("  - This imbalance affects likelihood calculations and creates the reversing trend")

println("=== IMMEDIATE FIX ===")
println("To fix this issue, you need to:")
println("1. Open E3/constants.jl")
println("2. Find the line: is_UnchangeCtxDriftAndReinstate = false")
println("3. Change it to: is_UnchangeCtxDriftAndReinstate = true")
println()

println("=== ALTERNATIVE FIX ===")
println("If you want to keep the current behavior but fix the imbalance:")
println("1. Set is_content_drift_between_study_and_test = false")
println("2. OR ensure both context types drift with similar probabilities")

println("=== VERIFICATION ===")
println("After making the change:")
println("1. Run the debug script: julia debug_reversing_trend.jl")
println("2. Check that both context types are drifting")
println("3. Run your main simulation to verify the reversing trend is fixed")
println()

println("=== WHY THIS FIXES THE ISSUE ===")
println("Setting is_UnchangeCtxDriftAndReinstate = true ensures that:")
println("1. Both changing and unchanging context features drift during study-test intervals")
println("2. The drift patterns are balanced across different context types")
println("3. Likelihood calculations are not biased by systematic context differences")
println("4. Test position effects are consistent and don't create reversing trends")

println("Fix script completed. Follow the steps above to resolve the reversing trend issue.")
